 <h1 class="title">About #FollowtheMoneyCO</h1>
    
 <p>FollowtheMoneyCO is a campaign finance data site operated by <a href="https://twitter.com/fishnette" target="blank">Sandra Fish</a>. The site originated in 2020 as a joint project of the media collaborative COLab and the Colorado Sun, funded by the Colorado Media Project and the Colorado Sun.</p>

<p>The project aims to make Colorado campaign finance data more accessible to journalists and the public using downloadable data from the <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/Homepage.aspx" target="blank">Colorado Secretary of State’s TRACER</a>. </p>

<h3>The latest</h3>
<p>It's 2022, and we've got the data for candidates for state House, Senate and statewide offices, including University of Colorado Regent and Board of Education. We also have data spending and cash raised by super PACs, issue committees and traditional PACs and political parties.</p>

<h3>Where the data comes from</h3>

<p>The data comes from <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/DataDownload.aspx" target=“blank”>bulk downloads</a> on TRACER, the state’s campaign finance data system. </p>

<p>Sandra Fish, the Colorado data journalist managing the project, uses Python, Pandas and Jupyter notebook to create the tables, which are pared down from the original and include full names for contributors and payment recipients. These names have not been standardized.</p>

<p>For legislative candidates, the TRACER data is merged with a list of candidate committee numbers. Other tables are created by selecting committee types.</p>

<p>Information about contribution limits for various types of committees may be found on <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/CampaignFinance/limits/acceptance.html" target=“blank”> this page,</a> from the Secretary of State’s Office. The Campaign Finance Institute also offers an <a href="https://cfinst.github.io/" target=“blank”>interactive database</a> of campaign finance and disclosure laws in all 50 states, which is a great way to compare Colorado to other states.</p>
